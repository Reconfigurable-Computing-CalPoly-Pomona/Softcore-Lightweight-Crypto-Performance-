# Softcore-Lightweight-Crypto-Performance

## Overview

This project has been done as a collaboration between California State Polytechnic University Pomona and Xilinx on developing a low power computational technology while being a cost-efficient solution. The project is aimed towards using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms that will use softcore processors to perform image processing, cyber security, encryption, and high-performance applications for Defense. The main benchmarking methods were performed using encryptions on the MicroBlaze platform on a Basys3 board. The encrytions consist of RSA, AES, and ASCON. All references are documented at the end of this document.
